# Development Guidelines: AI-Powered Stock-Market Assistant

## General Principles

* **Code Quality:** Follow clean code practices (clear naming, single responsibility, modular functions).
* **Documentation:** Maintain clear inline comments and detailed README files.
* **Version Control:** Use consistent Git branching and commit conventions.

## Technology Stack

* **Backend:** Python
* **Data Storage:** PostgreSQL
* **Machine Learning:** LightGBM
* **Containerization:** Docker
* **Cloud Provider:** AWS

## Development Workflow

* **GitHub Management:**

  * Work on feature branches (`feature/`), merge to main through pull requests.

* **Docker:**

  * Provide Dockerfiles for reproducible builds.
  * Ensure Docker Compose scripts exist for local environment setups.

* **Testing:**

  * Write unit tests for all critical functions using `pytest`.
  * Integration tests for complete workflows.

* **Continuous Integration (CI):**

  * Set up GitHub Actions workflows.
  * Enforce automated linting (`black`, `ruff`) and testing (`pytest`).

## Deployment and Infrastructure

* Deploy via AWS EC2 instances.
* Automate deployments using GitHub Actions.
* Regular backups and disaster recovery plans are mandatory.

## Database Management

* Document all schema changes.
* Use migration scripts for schema evolution.

## Machine Learning

* Clearly document training data, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics.
* Use MLflow or similar tools for tracking experiments.
* Ensure reproducibility of model training and results.

## Monitoring and Logging

* Centralized logging for backend services.
* Track key performance indicators (latency, error rates, prediction accuracy).
* Regularly monitor model drift and performance degradation.

Adhering to these guidelines will ensure consistency, maintainability, and high-quality deliverables throughout the project lifecycle.
