# Project Overview: AI-Powered Stock-Market Assistant

## Objective

To develop an AI-powered assistant that provides users with actionable daily stock market insights and trade recommendations, leveraging data-driven analyses and machine learning models.

## What We Want to Achieve

* **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collect reliable market data, including stock prices, fundamental financial metrics, news sentiment, and social media insights.
* **Feature Engineering:** Derive meaningful financial indicators and sentiment scores to enrich data.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Train a robust machine learning model to identify trading opportunities and generate clear, actionable signals.
* **User Interaction:** Deliver daily trade signals via an intuitive Telegram bot interface and collect user feedback for continuous improvement.
* **Iterative Enhancement:** Continuously refine and validate the system through paper trading, performance evaluation, and incremental updates.

## How We Plan to Achieve It

### 1. Environment Setup

* AWS infrastructure for scalable and reliable hosting.
* Docker and GitHub workflows for standardized development and deployment.

### 2. Data Collection

* Gather historical stock prices using EODHistoricalData API.
* Aggregate relevant financial news through NewsAPI.
* Initial focus on key market indices (S\&P 500, TA-125).

### 3. Data Processing

* PostgreSQL to structure data efficiently.
* Automate nightly data ingestion via scheduled tasks.

### 4. Analysis and Modeling

* Compute key technical and fundamental indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI, P/E ratios).
* Implement basic sentiment analysis for additional market context.
* Employ a LightGBM model for predictive insights and perform rigorous back-testing.

### 5. Signal Generation

* Generate daily trade signals with clear strength rankings.
* Leverage machine learning predictions to inform signal accuracy and reliability.

### 6. User Interface

* Telegram bot integration for accessible daily notifications.
* Incorporate a feedback mechanism for user ratings to fine-tune model performance.

### 7. Validation and Iteration

* Conduct regular performance evaluations through simulated trading scenarios.
* Identify key areas for improvement and iteratively enhance model accuracy and signal quality.

This strategic and phased approach ensures a lean, efficient, and effective solution tailored for clear and actionable stock market decision support.
