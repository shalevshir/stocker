* [x] Set up `.env` with API keys and Telegram token

**QA / Validation:**

* SSH access verified ‚úîÔ∏è
* Basic Python environment set ‚úîÔ∏è

## Phase 1: Minimal Data Ingestion Pipeline (In Progress)

* [ ] Design simplified PostgreSQL schema (`prices`, `fundamentals`, `news_sentiment`)
* [ ] Implement EODHistoricalData fetcher (prices only, 5-year history for top 50 S\&P 500 and TA-125)
* [ ] Basic sentiment via NewsAPI
* [ ] Cron scripts for nightly data ingestion

**QA / Validation:**

* [ ] Perform basic back-test (1-year historical validation)

**QA / Validation:**

* Basic model training and prediction verified
* Back-test results documented

## Phase 4: Basic Signal Generation

* [ ] Daily inference to generate signals
* [ ] Simple ranking system for signal strength
